## Model Catalog
### Introduction
This is an effort to create machine learning models using datasets from 
books I have read in books, and public libraries like UCI

### List
Currently the catalog is:  
1. Clustering data from gene expression values - KMeans, ICA, TSNE: [DS01_Clust_TCGA.ipynb](./notebooks/DS01_Clust_TCGA.ipynb)
2. Regression for the abalone measures: [DS02_Regr_Abalone.ipynb](./notebooks/DS02_Regr_Abalone.ipynb)
3. Classification for adult income metrics: [DS03_Class_Adult_Income.ipynb](./notebooks/DS03_Class_Adult_Income.ipynb)

### Packages
Installed packages are in the requirements.txt file. Basically they are:
- ipykernel
- pandas
- seaborn
- plotly
- scikit-learn
